# FreeCodeCamp HTML Form Project

This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.  
It focuses on the basics of building forms in HTML, including:

- Using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouping form elements  
- Creating radio buttons for single-choice questions  
- Adding checkboxes for multiple-choice questions  
- Linking text with the `<a>` element  

## Preview
A simple form that asks about a catâ€™s personality and indoor/outdoor preference.  

## Learning Goals
- Practice HTML form structure  
- Understand the difference between checkboxes and radio buttons  
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
